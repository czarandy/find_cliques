Code for finding maximal cliques in a graph. See find_cliques_example.cpp for sample usage.

I also include some timing data in find_cliques_large_matrix.cpp, for large-ish matrices. Here is an example of the output on my system:

Matrix Size: 50, # of Cliques: 1057, Microseconds: 2023
Matrix Size: 100, # of Cliques: 3961, Microseconds: 18269
Matrix Size: 200, # of Cliques: 77603, Microseconds: 195028

The matrices in this example were randomly generated by taking each edge with probabiliy 0.5. For most matrices the number of cliques will scale exponentially with the size of the matrix, so finding all of them is infeasible for large matrices.
